# Optimizing-the-PL-registration-of-MMRS-images-using-MSOLG-features
This repository contains code of our work "Optimizing the Piecewise Linear Transformation in Multimodal Image Registration using Multi-scale and Multi-orientation Log-Gabor features"
The feature point pairs (FPPs) are obtained using RIFT, where the code can be found in https://github.com/LJY-RS/RIFT-multimodal-image-matching
The code of HOPC, and the test datasets in this letter are from https://github.com/yeyuanxin110/HOPC, and https://github.com/yeyuanxin110/CFOG
