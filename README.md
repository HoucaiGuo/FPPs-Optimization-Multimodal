# Optimizing-the-PL-registration-of-MMRS-images-using-MSOLG-features
This repository contains code of "Point Pairs Optimization for Piecewise Linear Transformation of Multimodal Remote Sensing Images by the Similarity of Log-Gabor Features". This letter has been submitted to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters and is waiting for peer review.

In this letter, the feature point pairs (FPPs) were optimized to achieve higher registration accuracy of piecewise linear (PL) transformation for multimodal remote sensing images. The FPPs were obtained using RIFT [1], where the code can be found in https://github.com/LJY-RS/RIFT-multimodal-image-matching. Outlier removal was conducted using Fast Sample Consensus [2], where the code is included in the RIFT's repository. Check points generated by HOPC [3] (https://github.com/yeyuanxin110/HOPC) were used to calculate the registration error. Test images are from the repository of HOPC and CFOG [4] (https://github.com/yeyuanxin110/CFOG)
